- In problem formalization: describe how to compute the variables that enter into the objective function for skewness, kurtosis, covariance
- Redo simulation!
  * Different data generation: 
    * at least two features in each data set
    * correlation between all features: .00, .10, .20, .30, .40, .50
  * Use two additional methods on data sets: kplus + skew/kurtosis; kplus + covariances
  * Use additional evaluation criteria: similarity of skew/kurtosis/correlations
  * describe how well kplus + skew/kurtosis and kplus + covariances approximate kplus and k-means
  * Use anticlustering version 0.6.1 (is on CRAN)
  * Do not assess how well kplus approximates kmeans (this is confusing anyway)

- in anticlust, include a function "kplus_anticlustering" with arguments variance (logical; default = TRUE); skewness (logical; default = FALSE); kurtosis (logical; default = FALSE); covariances (logical; default = FALSE); as higher_order_moments (integer vector, to specify higher order moments than kurtosis)
