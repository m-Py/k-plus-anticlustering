\normalsize{\textit{Note.} The global results of the simulation study aggregated across all conditions. Cells contain information about the average global between-group discrepancy with regard to means, standard deviations, skewness and kurtosis. Lower values indicate less discrepancy, i.e., higher between-group similarity. Each cell value is the result of averaging across 30,000 data points (10,000 data sets $\times$ $K = 2$, $K = 3$ or $K = 4$).}
